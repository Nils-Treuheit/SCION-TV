vp9 looseless - slightly worse, visible difference, not as sharp, studders, stream started and ended in fragments, not realtime nor stable
vp9 realtime - poor quality, visible difference, even less sharp, color issues, more stable
avc looseless - not watchable 
avc ultrafast - nearly indistinguishable from original stream, sometimes tiny bit less sharp, very stable
avc medium - nearly indistinguishable from avc ultrafast, stream started and ended in fragments, not realtime nor stable
avc verslow - slightly worse, visible difference, better than vp9 looseless, stream started and ended in fragments, not realtime nor stable
hevc looseless - best video quality, basically indistinguishable from original stream but not realtime capable 
hevc ultrafast - almost same as avc ultrafast but some artefacts and not as stable for realtime transcoding as avc
